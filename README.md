## Shark Attacks:
In this project, we utilize the shark attack dataset and use Python to clean and explore the data, validate our hypotheses, and extract meaningful insights.

---
### Hypotheses:
- <b>Hypothesis 1:</b>
Shark attacks tend to happen in particular locations and during specific times of the year (seasons).
- <b>Hypothesis 2:</b>
Certain activities and human factors, such as gender, may influence the occurrence of shark attacks.
---
### Conclusion and Findings: 
- We confirmed that location (Country & State) and season are relevant when assessing the risk of shark attacks.
Key Finding: Summer is the primary season for shark attacks across hemispheres.

- Examining top activities linked to increased shark attack risks was useful, but human factors such as gender showed minimal insights or correlations with activities.
